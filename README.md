# Pianoforall

I'm currently taking the [Pianoforall](https://www.udemy.com/pianoforall-incredible-new-way-to-learn-piano-keyboard/)
course by [Robin Hall](https://www.udemy.com/user/robinhall3/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) in an attempt to acquire some musical skills.

As I do this, I want to learn more about how to use [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) by [Sam Aaron](https://twitter.com/samaaron), so I'll be attempting
to translate the lessons I do in the course into code that can be run in Sonic Pi.
